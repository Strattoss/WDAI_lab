# Introduction to Web Apps Labs (WDAI)

This repository contains exercises for the "Introduction to Web Apps" course in the 3rd semester. The labs cover various web development topics, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.

## General Information

Be aware that the lab6 files do not fully reflect the lab6 script requirements. After the semester had finished, the whole app was refined to match a specific 'aesthetics.' This refinement was not possible during the semester and exam session due to time constraints.

## Warning!

Hardly any lab has been finished properly, so there are (sometimes huge) holes and/or unfinished exercises.

## Laboratories

1. [HTML5 and CSS Page Design](lab1)
   * In this lab, I practiced designing web pages using HTML5 and adding styles with CSS. By the end of this session, I gained knowledge of how to independently create web pages using clean HTML5 and CSS.

3. [Responsive Web Design (RWD) and CSS3](lab2)
   * In Lab 2, I explored the concepts of Responsive Web Design and learned about dynamic properties introduced by CSS3. This familiarized me with building web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

4. [JavaScript and DOM Manipulation](lab3)
   * Lab 3 focuses on programming with JavaScript. Now I know how to manage events and modify the Document Object Model (DOM). After the lab, I have a better understanding of interactive web development.

5. [Introduction to Angular Framework](lab4)
   * In this lab, I started working with the Angular framework and the concept of components. The main theme was working with components, both as standalone entities and in communication with each other. Three different cases were covered: parent-child communication, child-parent communication, and communication between unrelated components using services.

6. [Handling Real Data and Application Routing](lab5)
   * Lab 5 is all about handling real production data from a server. The data is stored persistently on the backend. Additionally, I addressed the issue of organizing our client application by displaying components efficiently. I achieved this by leveraging the concept of routing.

7. [Security in Web Applications](lab6)
   * In this lab, I familiarized myself with security concerns in web applications. I learned about authentication and authorization as mechanisms for controlling access to specific application resources. I implemented a data and view sharing mechanism restricted to authorized users only. To achieve this, I used Firebase's Authentication module. There was an alternative method: implementing my own authentication and authorization functionality, extending the capabilities of the Web server.
