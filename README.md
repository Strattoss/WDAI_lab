# WDAI_lab
This repository contains 6 packages of exercises for 3rd semester course "Introduction to Web Apps" ("Wprowadzenie do Aplikacji Internetowych in polish).
Each package is dedicated to different topic, except 4, 5, 6, which all focus on Angular.
Be aware that lab6 files do not reflect lab6 script requirements, because after the semester had finished, I refined whole app, so it matches my 'aesthetics' :). I couldn't do it before due to lack of time during semester and exam session.
If you want to see lab6 previous to these changes, look at this commit https://github.com/Strattoss/WDAI_lab/tree/6d56b90109088d8b65f77eaf54eb1797aa6adb01.
